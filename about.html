            Hi! I'm Cedar and this is my Node.js application. It has an about page (where you are now), a navigation page, a page with four dog breeds and their pictures, a page with four cat breeds and their pictures, and a page for today's work playlist, which is the playlist I was listening to while working on this. Right now the playlist is just a list of songs I was listening to with each artists that wrote the song, but maybe in the future they'll include links to the actual songs or the songs embedded in the page.

            I'm 24, I like dogs and cats a lot, I love pretty much all kinds of music, I REALLY like coffee, and I spent so much time on the CSS for this page because I hate Bootstrap because I am a control freak but I'm not great at CSS. I love programming, but man, CSS is just not my thing.
